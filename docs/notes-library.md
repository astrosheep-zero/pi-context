# Standalone notes library

The same package provides a **Node.js TypeScript library independent of Pi**:

```sh
npm install notesoup
```

```ts
import { createNotesStore, type NotesIdentity } from "notesoup/notes";

const identity: NotesIdentity = {
  home: "/path/to/notes",          // explicit filesystem root
  sessionId: "my-session",        // safe single directory component
  projectKey: "my-project-a1b2c3d4",
  agent: "my-agent",              // canonical lowercase slug
  model: "my-model",              // canonical lowercase slug
};
const notes = createNotesStore(identity);
await notes.write("@project/decisions.md", "Use a shared notes library.", { origin: "user" });
await notes.update("@project/decisions.md", [
  { oldText: "shared", newText: "host-independent" },
]);
const note = await notes.read("@project/decisions.md"); // body and metadata, or undefined
const files = await notes.list({ pattern: "@project/**" });
const matches = await notes.search(["library"]);
```

`/notes` ships JavaScript and TypeScript declarations. It does not import Pi or read `PI_*` environment variables. Pi packages are optional peers: a notes-only installation does not install them. Using the plugin, root SDK entry, or `dream` CLI still requires Pi. This is a filesystem library for Node, not a browser storage API.

## API and identity

`createNotesStore(identity)` snapshots the five required identity fields; changing the supplied object afterward does not retarget the store. It resolves `home` once, validates identity components, and creates no files until an operation needs to write. Create a new store to change identity. Multiple stores can use independent roots and identities without changing process environment.

- `write(address, content, { origin? }?)` returns `Promise<{ meta, outcome }>` (`created`, `overwritten` or `uncrumpled`). Default origin is `self`; overwriting preserves creation time, existing project ownership, and unknown metadata, and always produces an uncrumpled note (it clears any `crumpledAt`).
- `read(address)` returns `Promise<{ meta, body, resolvedScope } | undefined>`. **Reads update** `lastAccessed` and `accessCount` on disk. The body is separate from metadata; the serialized frontmatter is not part of the read API.
- `update(address, edits?, { origin?, crumpled?, replaceAll? }?)` returns `Promise<{ meta, applied, resolvedScope, change }>`. Edits affect the body; metadata-only changes need no edits, but must supply `origin` or `crumpled`. `crumpled: true` records `crumpledAt` (keeping the original time if already set); `crumpled: false` removes it; omitted leaves it unchanged. Crumpling and smoothing never change `updatedAt`, which tracks body or origin changes only. Each replacement uses the evolving body in array order; the complete batch is written atomically only after every edit succeeds. `change` is a typed `{ kind, before, after }`: `kind` is `body`, `metadata`, or `file` to identify the diff inputs, or `none` with empty strings when neither body, origin, nor `crumpledAt` changed. It is not a rendered diff.
- `rename(fromAddress, toAddress)` returns `Promise<{ meta, replacedCrumpledTarget }>`. The note moves with every metadata key preserved (`updatedAt` is bumped); a live note at the target refuses with `already_exists`, a crumpled target is replaced, and renaming onto the same resolved path is `nothing_to_do`.
- `list({ pattern?, scope?, who?, wastebasket? }?)` returns `Promise<NoteRow[]>`, sorted by update time descending with address tie-breaking. Rows contain address, scope, virtual path, metadata, body, and body byte size. `scope` narrows the five-home view; `who` names a concrete agent/model home. By default crumpled notes are excluded; `wastebasket: true` returns only crumpled notes instead.
- `search(queries: string[], { pattern?, scope?, who?, wastebasket? }?)` returns `Promise<NoteSearchRow[]>`, sorted by address, with the same crumpled-note rule as `list`. Matching is case-insensitive literal OR over body lines; matches contain one-based `line`, `text`, and `offsetChars` into the body, excluding frontmatter. Neither listing nor search increments access metadata.

`list` and `search` share the `NotesQuery` type. A merged query uses `{ pattern?, wastebasket? }`; a single-home query adds `scope`. Only `scope: "agent" | "model"` accepts `who`. TypeScript rejects combinations such as `{ scope: "project", who: "root" }`, and JavaScript callers receive a runtime refusal.

The library returns full data, not tool envelopes or paginated/truncated output. `NoteError` exposes the existing named store refusals through `code`, with `lineNumbers` for ambiguous edits and `editIndex` for a failed edit. Runtime API fields and known persisted note metadata use camelCase; Pi tool wire fields such as `updated_at`, `offset_chars`, and `replace_all` retain their established names. Unrecognized frontmatter keys, including old snake_case metadata, are preserved as ordinary extras; they are not interpreted as current camelCase fields or migrated automatically. Invalid addresses/identities and filesystem failures reject; only a missing `read` returns `undefined`. Notes remain markdown files with the existing size limits and same-directory atomic rename. Same-file read/modify/write work is serialized by absolute physical filename across all store instances in this process (including `.md` address aliases); symlink/case aliases and cross-process locking are not guaranteed. `list` and `search` asynchronously traverse homes and serialize each discovered file read against pending mutations, but are not global snapshots and may not discover a file created after traversal. Foreign named homes can be read (including the access-metadata update), but their bodies cannot be written or edited through the store. These are cooperative address rules, not an OS security sandbox.

Addresses are a path with no `@` (a session note), `@project/`, `@human/`, `@self/`, `@model/`, or explicit `@agents/<slug>/` and `@models/<slug>/`. Relative self/model addresses resolve to the supplied identity. Results show the current agent's and model's notes as `@self/` and `@model/`; only other agents' or models' notes carry an explicit `@agents/<slug>/` or `@models/<slug>/`. Patterns accept either form. The disk layout remains `pi/session/<sessionId>/`, `project/<projectKey>/`, `human/`, `agents/<agent>/`, and `models/<model>/`. No data migration happens on library import or construction. Notes already using camelCase metadata retain their metadata; old snake_case keys are preserved as unrecognized extras, not interpreted or migrated. New session notes record the supplied project key.

## Library and plugin boundary

Ownership is explicit in the file tree:

```text
src/
  index.ts               # only the Pi extension and createNotesoup factory
  notes/                 # filesystem semantics and explicit NotesIdentity

  history/               # decoded query projection, pairing, paging and folding
  budget/                # pure thresholds, countdown policy and reminder text
  tools/                 # operation schemas, typed outcomes and bounded presentation
  dream/                 # jail, deletion policy, locks, gates, audit, reports, doctor
  settings.ts            # SDK-independent settings keys and per-key parsing
  pi/                    # native integration, not part of /notes
    extension.ts         # registration composition
    runtime.ts           # native lifecycle, commands, provider projection and UI
    window.ts            # native markers, checkpoints, branches and usage
    history.ts           # native decoding, seq allocation and branch selection
    notes/               # live identity extraction, registration and native diffs
    reset/               # reducer, boundary drafts, commit confirmation and repair
    dream/               # Pi session backend, settings reads and CLI
```

The public runtime exports are `createNotesStore`, `NoteError`, `projectKey(cwd)`, and `slugify(value)`, alongside the API's TypeScript types. The factory and `projectKey` remain synchronous; `projectKey` provides the existing repository/worktree identity algorithm, while `slugify` normalizes an agent/model name. The six primary store methods return promises and use asynchronous filesystem operations. Path/glob helpers, serialization, validation internals and constants are implementation details, not exported through `/notes`.

The Pi adapter supplies the root and live session/project/agent/model identity on each call. Tools and boot use the same storage implementation. Shared tool schemas use `typebox`, declared as a peer supplied by Pi and as a dev dependency for standalone development; their handlers accept explicit identities or decoded history projections. Pi owns registration, execution-context extraction and native edit diff rendering. Boot snapshot acquisition receives identity, a captured timestamp and an optional home loader; rendering receives explicit logical tool names. Native session traversal, stable seq allocation, branch selection and inference projection stay in Pi. Shared history is a query view, never a way to reconstruct inference messages. There are no compatibility shims or generic host runtime. Internal source paths are not the supported library API.
