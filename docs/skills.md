# Skills, dream, and the notes doctor

## Memory skill

The package provides `/skill:memory`, a short self-contained guide to the notes and history tools: note addresses and homes, finding and paging notes, searching and paging history, saving recovery state, and what to do when a memory tool is unavailable. It is a fallback for sessions where the boot protocol is missing or unclear and a reference on demand; normal tool calls do not require reading it. It is written independently of the boot text rather than generated from it. The Claude Code Mod does not ship it, because that host has no history tools.

## Dream skill

The package also provides `/skill:dream` for reviewing notes in the current agent session. The skill reads the same `playbook.md` used by the `dream` CLI; there is only one set of dream instructions.

Scope comes from the invocation directory: inside the notes store, dream may inspect across homes; in a project, it extracts from that project's material and all session notes with matching project metadata, and organizes only that project's notes. New session notes record their project key in the frontmatter `project` field. Standard linked Git worktrees resolve to the main checkout's repository root, sharing its project key and `@project/` home. Older metadata and homes remain untouched by the code: there is no automatic migration or backfill; existing data can be migrated manually. Notes without project metadata are skipped in project-only discovery. Changing directories later does not broaden the scope.

The skill stays in the current agent session. Its wrapper and shared playbook describe the dreamer's task, not runtime setup: the execution entry point is responsible for supplying readable/writable scope and establishing write permission, including locking and Git audit safeguards. The CLI supplies its own safeguards; the bare skill does not install them. Without an established scope and write permission, the dreamer asks rather than improvising runtime setup. Session records and unapproved homes stay untouched.

## Check the notes store

Run `dream doctor` (or `dream doctor --notes-home <dir>`) to check home layout, note frontmatter, concrete backtick-quoted note addresses, MAP entries, and lock presence/format. It is read-only: no model, git commits, directory creation, or repairs. Exit status is 0 when clean and 1 when issues are found. References needing an unavailable project context are reported as unresolved; prose and example/glob addresses are not validated. A present lock is reported without inferring process liveness.

## The dream lock

The `dream` CLI takes an exclusive `.dream.lock` in the notes home with a single O_CREAT|O_EXCL creation. The lock is Git-style existence locking: an existing lock refuses a new run regardless of its contents, PID, or age, and `--force` bypasses only the scheduling and material gates, never the lock. A lock is released only by the run that acquired it (and repeated cleanup is harmless), so a live dream is never displaced.

If a dream process crashed, its lock remains and later runs refuse to start. There is no automatic recovery and no force-unlock command: after you have confirmed that no dream process is running, remove the stale lock by hand.

```sh
# only when no dream is running
rm "${PI_NOTES_HOME:-$HOME/.agents/notes}/.dream.lock"
```

Removing a lock while a holder is running is outside the supported cooperative protocol and can let two dreams run at once.
